A note on system that is installed on sd-card.

On SD Card there is clean Debian 7 Wheezy, and some improvements:

* /tmp is mounted on tmpfs (RAM) to speed up and carry on card
* kernel and libc and openssh is HOLD in aptitude to prevent from segfaults in pthread.so when updating system

What you (as teacher with stidens) can do is:

* change the name of system ( vim /etc/hostname )
* make another partition on SD CARD mount in somewhere, in example /opt ( vim /etc/fstab )

What you must do is:

* install all neccesary software for our project ( deb_install.sh )
